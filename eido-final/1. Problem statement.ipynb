Think of it like solving a mystery where the clues are different features of the Airbnb listings, such as where it's located (the neighborhood), what type of place it is (entire home, private room, etc.), and what amenities it offers (Wi-Fi, kitchen, pool, etc.).\n","### Question\n","* What are the critical features that determine whether an Airbnb listing is expensive or affordable?\n","* How do specific features of Airbnb listings correlate with their pricing?\n","\n","#How We Do It:\n","\n","* **Collect Data**: We start by gathering a lot of data about Airbnb listings. This\n","includes all sorts of information, like prices, locations, types of accommodations, and the amenities they offer.\n","* **Clean and Organize**: Next, we clean up this data. This means we make sure all the information is in a format we can easily work with. For example, we make sure all the names of the features are consistent (like making sure we use \"wifi\" instead of \"Wi-Fi\" in some places and \"wifi\" in others).\n","* **Analyze:** With our clean data, we look for patterns. We try to see if certain features, like being close to the city center or having a pool, tend to make listings more expensive.\n","\n","#Objective 2: Developing a Predictive Model for Airbnb Listing Prices\n","* **Goal**: The second goal is to build a tool that can guess how much an Airbnb listing should cost based on its characteristics. It's like creating a smart calculator that, once you tell it about a listing (its location, what type of place it is, and what it offers), can tell you how much that place should be priced at.\n","### Question\n","* Can we predict the price of an Airbnb listing based on its characteristics?\n","* What features are most important in predicting the price of an Airbnb listing?\n","* How can the predictive model be improved for greater accuracy in estimating Airbnb listing prices?\n","\n","#How We Do It:\n","\n","* Select Important Features: Based on our analysis, we pick out the characteristics (like location, room type, and amenities) that really matter in determining the price.\n","* Build the Model: We use all the data we've cleaned and the important features we've identified to build a mathematical model. This model looks at the prices of many listings and learns the patterns of how different features affect those prices.\n","* Test and Improve: We make sure our model is good at guessing prices by testing it with data it hasn't seen before. If it's not as accurate as we want, we tweak it by maybe adding more features or adjusting how much importance we give to certain features."],"metadata":{"id":"7AAaCmQYFMV_"},"id":"7AAaCmQYFMV_"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.4"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
